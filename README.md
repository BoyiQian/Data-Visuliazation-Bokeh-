# Data-Visuliazation-Bokeh-
There are three python file about Visulization of Game data using Bokeh with user interation.

# Data
I used several datasets in our project. I started with one found on Kaggle, Video Game
Sales, which was collected by crawling a website called vgchartz. It’s a very interesting dataset
with more than 40 thousand entries and 11 columns with detailed sales data of different regions
and views. It also includes many attributes that describe the data such as console, genre, and
year. Other than the I wrote our crawling script to retrieve a small but more complete dataset
from vgchartz and crawled the review from Metacritic.
Goals
The purpose of this project is to help publishers and developers understand how to gain more
profit by selling buy-out games. The analysis will focus on the relationship between selling
numbers with genre, date, region, rating by comparing the historical selling numbers with
differences of attributes of games. I will answer the following questions.
1. How does the sales number vary among different regions through different years?
2. Is there a genre that is more favorable to users? What’s the relationship between Genre
and sell number and how does it change based on regions through years?
3. How did developers perform in each of their games? How does the reputation of
developers and games affect sales?
4. What are the characteristics of best-selling games?
